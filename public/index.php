<!--<h2>Focus</h2>-->
<!--<p>-->
<!--    24 carefully picked life areas.<br>-->
<!--    <span>It took me a few years of research and contemplation to come to these items. Consideration of broad as possible alternatives were taken into account also, e.g. ancient religions of various cultures, organizational structures of today's governments and business units. The final list happened to be very similar to the one of Feng Shui as I accidentally found I may put almost anyone's interests into the list. Ancient and recent interests fits just well.</span>-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<h2>Success</h2>-->
<!--<p>-->
<!--    Balance converts to happiness and success.<br>-->
<!--    <span>It is possible to work hard for 16 hours and get to the bed for an 8 hours sleep, and continue like that until you become mi-bi-llionaire. However, there are some things in life you need that are just different from what you think you need, for example, you need to take care of your own health, you need to have fun, you need to have friends, etc. Otherwise the life becomes somehow meaningless, especially in case you burn out or fall into depression, which is quite easy to do by concentrating on a very few life areas while abandoning the rest. I have been broadly researching the topic for a while now and I came to the conclusion that many wise texts agree on too - you are truly successful after you are good at all life areas. Being perfect (above the "good") on half and zero (beyond the "good") at another half leads to misery. For example, as a conclusion, I consider having 1 good friend and 1 good car is better than having 0 good friends and 1 or 2 extremely fancy cars. Otherwise is also true, e.g. having 1-2 extremely good friends and 0 in the pocket may become a really bad situation very soon too.</span>-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<h2>Measure</h2>-->
<!--<p>-->
<!--    Get to know yourself.<br>-->
<!--    <span>Keep track of your progress through the time. Take a test from time to time to get to know where you are in life in general, how do you progress.</span>-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<h2>Help Yourself</h2>-->
<!--<p>-->
<!--    Empower weaknesses, invest strengths.<br>-->
<!--    <span>Juggle your situation by trying to match the best of yourself with the worst of yourself. We will advice you on the way, don't worry.</span>-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<h2>Help Others</h2>-->
<!--<p>-->
<!--    Empower others, invest self.<br>-->
<!--    <span>You may be in a total disaster with your life, just get into the threads of each life area and improve by following advices of others. Are you ok? Nice! Let others know what you do to be so!</span>-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--<h2>It's a different tool for myself and like-minded people</h2>-->
<!--<p>-->
<!--    The tool grows organically.<br>-->
<!--    <span>It's a tool, not just a random website with some texts and links on. I am a developer and I build this website as a tool to solve many of my own problems in life, from the tickable list of daily habits for each of life areas, to the balance sheets to track family expenses, and much more above! Sure, if there is a very good solution already, I don't try to remake it as "my own". However, there are many areas of life that lacks extra development, and here we are about to introduce the upgrade to such.</span>-->

<!---->
<!--    We name the 24 life areas, aka. values - that's what's the most important in the life.-->
<!--    If you agree, consider to <a href="">join in the like minded</a>.-->
<!---->
<!---->
<!---->
<!--    We have certain limits and random obstacles in our life - that's why we have to constantly prioritize the areas.-->
<!---->
<!---->
<!---->
<!---->
<!--    The point of naming values is to verbally direct a being towards the parts of life that matter THE MOST.-->
<!--    As for example, your own immune system may be fighting for the overall well being of body of yours by eliminating the threat, it also may be a group of people working towards the same goal.-->
<!---->
<!--    In order for the life to become meaningful, you have to pick values at first - that's the base - the foundation of the life. There are many think in life, you have to pick something to hold on the life on.-->
<!--    As for example, being able to pick the values makes you an adult.-->
<!---->
<!--    In order for the life to become manageable, you also have to be able to rank the values.-->
<!--    As for example, that's how you decide you need to stay for another hour up (e.g. work) or you need to get some sleep (e.g. rest) now.-->
<!---->
<!--    However, being able to rank values is not the whole story, this does not make you wise enough in terms of others. In order to live the successful life of a society, we have to be able to individually recognize the values of others and act accordingly.-->
<!--    As for example, if you see someone is going to trick you - then you run away, if you see someone is going to help you - then you accept. That's how you build the life, right?-->
<!---->
<!--    Sure, as a society we may live as individuals but that's not what happens most of the time due to values that act as our base in a subconccious way.-->
<!--    For example, we may say we want to help others but at some point we recognize a "thank you" or "you are amazing" back is of huge importance too.-->
<!---->
<!--    Some of these hidden values acting through our subconcious and instincs helps society, and some - hurts. We have to be able to pick the right ones and suppress the bad ones.-->
<!--    For example, we may get to want to scream at the the person because we want to express the anger instantly - that's bad, or we may to explain other how do we feel and decide on what should we better do next.-->
<!---->
<!--    Either way, we individually are not well perfect for the society. However, we may train ourselves and become better or worse at some of the things society matters. We even may influence what society matters..-->
<!--    For example, we may train our body to become stronger, we may read books or talk to a wise person to become wiser, we may build a trust, do things others would laugh on.-->
<!---->
<!--    However, we will always have our weaknesses and strengths. Therefore we get into teams to compensate each other.-->
<!--    For example, that's how companies work - some individuals like to talk - they sell to people and manage people, some likes to work with stuff so they are locked in silence almost all day long. All work as a unit under the same company.-->
<!---->
<!--    Either way, even if we keep having these strengths and weaknesses, we are still able to strive for the balance and prosperity of values.-->
<!--    For example, we may plan our days wiser, we may look for a mentor or other type of professional, we may learn to use a tool or otherwise improve the self.-->
<!---->
<!---->
<!---->
<!---->
<!---->
<!--    It's also important to be abe to rank the values in the best possible way so you do not contradict with other beings and so you instantly know what is better in a certain situation - at the moment of being - now. In case you have the values ranked - you start to feel certain.-->
<!--    As for example, if anyone asks what to do, you have the answer based on your values.-->
<!---->
<!---->
<!---->
<!--    Being able to name the values makes you a self-conscious being.-->
<!--    The values picked must be THE MOST stable things of all that exists, of all you experience in life. Therefore values are not things, these are rather abstracts, patterns, or alike phenomena a one agrees one as existing one.-->
<!---->
<!---->
<!--    No one likes to pick an unstable base for the life - no one likes to build the life on the base which is-->

<!--    This way the invite for individual and also collective focus becomes - real thing, and the upcoming collaboration becomes - possible.-->

<!--    The list of the items shown above is my own list which is highly influenced by Feng Shui material I have found. I will probably make the ability for you to create your own list, if you wish (not decided yet).-->
<!--    However, I took quite a long time (actually, a few years) to understand the meaning of values. The list of 24 items given above is the outcome of the research involving structures of various organizations, ancient hierarchies of gods and alike material targeted to values as a base for the action, e.g. living the life meaningfully.-->

<!--<h2>Be, Dare, Care, Share!</h2>-->
<!---->
<!--<p>-->
<!--    Be honest with your self and dare to take a test to find out if you are doing better than me on the particular life areas. Warning: I am not perfect ;)<br>-->
<!--    In case You are doing better, I am curious to learn from your experience - do care and share your "know-how" story publicly or privately (me only).<br>-->
<!--    In case I am doing better, feel free to browse around, learn along, and if that's not enough - ask for a help like new features, mentorship, etc.<br>-->
<!--    We are all bound to succeed if we don't stop and help each other on the way!-->

All of that is about describing your own user profile - who you want to be, how should you act in a big and small scale, e.g. when would you wake up, which shoes you would buy, etc.">Best role to play</li>
        <li title="Get familiar with the available resources e g. investopedia, track current balance (income, expenses), assets generation, how much liabilities takes away., - inspired by Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert T.

        <li title="Introduce to people who do what you do, e.g. tax office person for the launch., - inspired by Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert T. Kiyosaki">Meetings with people who knows more</li>

        <li>Metrics: KPI</li>
        <li title="BRAVING can be a useful way to inventory strengths and areas for improvement in working relationships with subordinates. So, what are these behaviors?

The B stands for boundaries. This element of trust involves respecting others’ boundaries. If either party is unsure of the other’s boundaries, they ask whether or not something is okay, and the other person feels comfortable enough to say no if it isn’t.

The R stands for reliability, or doing what we say we will. In a work context, this translates into being aware of our abilities and limitations so that we don’t end up overpromising and under-delivering on commitments.

The A stands for accountability. We take ownership of our mistakes, apologize for them and try our best to make amends.

The V stands for vault. We can think of ourselves as a vault of information that other people have shared with us over time. An important aspect of trust is not passing on information that is not ours to pass on. Other people need to trust that we will keep their confidences and also need to see that we are not sharing other’s confidential information with them.

The I stands for integrity - choosing courage instead of comfort, and doing what is right rather than what is easy, fun or expedient. It also means practicing the same values that we preach.

The N stands for non-judgment, which means people know that they can tell us how they really feel or ask for help without expecting us to judge them for doing so.

The G stands for generosity, being consistently generous in our interpretation of the words, actions and intentions of others. People are more likely to trust us if they know we always see the best in others, rather than the worst.

Implement these behaviors to become a successful, trustworthy leader.

            The lack of customer demand - the biggest issue! So get all the facts, google, research, etc! Create hipothesis and try to prove it wrong!
Set clear goal, max 10 for the upcominig time, e.g. 1 year from now. Use Present tense. E.g. "I complete my novel by 21st of August this year".Dont use negative, e.g. "stop eating junk food" is not right, use "i am healthy eater" instead.Gind one of these many goals to achieve this year. That becomes the major purpose of life.
Take a piece of paper and name 20 or so things to make the goal reality. E.g. "research potential editors", "complete writing classes". Make this list a checklist and tackle the first item asap.
What others would like you to pay for?
Write down all the things todo.1. which results to the biggest?2. which results to the biggest if 2 is taken?3. which ... if 3 is taken?Take all 3.
Check what you do and look for the problem. Adress it.(and thats the probl because i dive to deep, e.g. up to the wrong values of groups of people)
