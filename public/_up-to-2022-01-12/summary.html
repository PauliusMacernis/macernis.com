I am currently working as a PHP web developer. Actually, I have worked part-time since 2007, and working full-time since 2012. Which means I have changed a few companies on the way, and have been fitting well in quite different cultures on the way too. For example, working with clients or dev teams in Lithuania is not the same as working with the ones in Norway, Canada, Monaco, etc. But I love the difference, and I feel hungry for not having a multicultural environment for a longer time. The company I work with now states I am a tech lead of the "Akeneo PIM" team while I do not think I deserve such a title because there are people in the company with much more technical knowledge. But let it be... However, I am happily accepting titles I have gained on my own initiative after passing a few well known IT exams and so becoming certified according to the official statements of the well known industry players, e.g. Zend, AWS, CompTIA, etc. I just like learning for certificates - it gives a beautiful path to go through, a very good material to learn from, and a very nice community in most of the cases too. But.. There is at least one more point to be mentioned after learning and achieving the mentioned - the near death experience in 2016 have brought me back on earth, in some sense. I feel much better if I have an opportunity to commit to the "cultural memory" now, and I even look for such opportunities by myself much more often now. Cultural memory is a much broader type of memory - it's the one that stays here, even if you die one day. Memento mori, my friend. And all of these thoughts do not mean I have to strive for the trace or the higher position in the society no matter what. It rather means I have to foster cultural memory in the best possible way I am able to. To mention, it's not that easy as it sounds. The hardest part of all is to get to know the self so helping in the most efficient way becomes possible: what are the strengths (my own hidden and exposed talents), weaknesses (talents of other people I try to pursuit just because I thought  someone is amazingly awesome), opportunities (you have to speak out or the opposite, to remain silent, in certain situations, no matter what), threats (in general, it's important to know the limits and so obstacles like biases, various paradoxes, keep balancing between effects and syndromes, etc.). Therefore concentrating just on coding alone is not enough, the need to be improving on all major life areas exists. Sure, me alone is not enough to change the course of the world to the desired direction. However, helping other souls empowers me in the eyes of myself and this is enough to be proud of living this life. Some goals are simply taking longer to achieve compared to the length of one person's life, and that's ok.
