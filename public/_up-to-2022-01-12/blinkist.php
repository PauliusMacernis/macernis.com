        Inspired by Moral Tribes by Joshua Greene
        <li title="The researchers Baba Shiv and Alexander Fedorikhin proved this in an experiment in 1999. In their study, the participants were told to memorize a number, walk down a hallway and tell a tester the number. Half of the participants were given a two-digit number to memorize, the other half a seven-digit number. Clearly, the second group had the greater cognitive task. In the hallway, subjects were instructed to take one of two snack options, either a healthy piece of fruit or a slice of rich chocolate cake. It turned out that those under a higher cognitive load were 50 percent more likely to opt for the chocolate cake. This happened because they were in automatic mode. In other words, they were guided by intuition and emotion. Our automatic mode only cares for what we can get in the moment. In this case, the rich charms of cake were hard to resist. The automatic mode is built up from our accumulated responses shaped by genes, cultural experiences, as well as trial and error. Manual mode, however, works differently. In it, reasoning and thinking play a key role. The controlled manual mode mulls over short- and long-term benefits. So in Shiv and Fedorikhin’s experiment, it reminded participants with lower cognitive loads that the fruit was better for them. The general lesson here is clear: automatic thinking leads to more errors but allows for easier decision-making, without overloading the conscious mind. Equally, as we saw with the participants who had to remember seven digits, the automatic mode is a fallback option when the manual mode is busy.">Keep it simple as possible</li>

        Inspired by Safe People by Dr. Henry Cloud and Dr. John Townsend
        <li title="First, ask for help. This teaches you humility, shows you your needs, forces you to take initiative, and gives you an avenue to show grace. It might also get you the help you need!">ask for help</li>
        <li title="Second, acknowledge your needs but remain authentic to who you are. If you don’t like too many hugs, for example, don’t try and suddenly become physically demonstrative.">acknowledge your needs but remain authentic to who you are</li>

        <li title="The fifth step is two-pronged: Learn to give and receive forgiveness. Don’t just say sorry – really empathize and admit fault without making excuses. When you accept forgiveness properly from a safe person, it’s truly liberating.">Learn to give and receive forgiveness.</li>
        <li title="And this brings us to the final step. Once you’ve learned to take from safe people, you can start giving back. Seek out places and people in your community where you can take and receive safety. Read others’ need signals; ask how you can help. Be present, listen, and tell the truth.">Seek out places and people in your community where you can take and receive safety.</li>

        <li title="Of course, nations have grown a lot larger since Rousseau's day, and it’s obviously unrealistic to expect entire populations to meet together in a public space. However, local government is an entirely different animal, and you may find that there are more opportunities to make an impact on the laws of your city or province than on your nation as a whole. There are probably already local assemblies and meetings run by your regional administration that you could drop by on. But, if that doesn’t sound to your taste, there are also plenty of political action groups and NGOs looking for volunteers to help run their campaigns in the wider world.">Engage in democratic actions to help keep your government accountable.</li>

        Inspired by Return on Ambition by Nicolai Chen Nielsen and Nicolai Tillisch
        <li title="The key message in these blinks is that: Ambition is neither good nor bad. It can help you achieve your dreams or it can lead you to dead ends, bereft of fulfillment. So to get truly good returns on your ambition, consider it in terms of growth and well-being, not just achievement. Reflect on where your goals come from and whether they’re truly your own. Be sure to watch out for the darker form in which your ambition can express itself. And craft a personal philosophy of ambition to guide you along your path. In doing these things, you’ll set yourself up for greater returns on your ambition and a much more rewarding life. And here’s some more actionable advice: Set an immediate priority. While your philosophy of ambition can guide you in the long term, in the short term, you’ll need to figure out an immediate priority – the one thing that you need to give all your attention to for the next three months. Choose something aspirational and with the potential to have an impact on your return for ambition. In other words, something that challenges and excites you – and has a big payoff. It’s important to note that your immediate priority is singular – just one thing. While this may sound a bit unambitious, your immediate priority will help focus your ambition, channeling energy to where it’s needed most. This is the first goal of many that will start getting you those returns on your ambition – and as soon as you achieve it, set another!">Set an immediate priority based on growth and well-being, not just achievement.</li>

        <li title="Specifically, employees need four things from their managers – and whether or not they receive them can strongly impact their sense of well-being. First, employees look to their leaders for a sense of hope. They want to know whether there’s a plan for the future to ensure things will get better. They also want a sense of stability from their leaders; they need to know that they will be provided with the right resources to carry on with their jobs. Employees also need to be able to trust their managers. They need to feel they’re getting relevant information at the right time – even if that information is negative. Finally, when their well-being is threatened, employees need compassion from their leaders. Research suggests that employees worry less and feel more confident in their roles when they believe that their leaders have their best interests at heart.">Spread a sense of hope, a sense of stability, stand for trustable managers, promote compassion</li>

        Inspired by No Bad Parts by Richard C. Schwartz, PhD
        <li title="We’re all made up of multiple parts – different, sometimes contradictory personalities.">What other mind voices say?</li>
        <li title="We all possess a core Self – even though it’s not always visible. We have no bad parts, but our parts can become stuck in destructive roles. In order to heal, we need to reparent our inner children. When we create internal harmony, the outside world becomes more peaceful as well. Healing is about learning to be in our bodies and experiencing pain. Connect with your inner parts through daily practice. ">Share what other voices say. You will heal.</li>
        <li title="The author witnessed the same characteristics coming up again and again when people described their Selves. He calls these characteristics the eight Cs – which are curiosity, courage, connectedness, compassion, confidence, calm, and clarity. If you want to know whether you’re in tune with your Self, think about how many of these qualities you experience as you go through your day. Do you respond with curiosity to your inner fears, or are you immediately critical and scared? Do you feel mentally clear and focused? And what do your connections with other people look like? Doing intense inner work can seem self-absorbed, like being engaged in continuous navel-gazing. But, in fact, the more you work with your parts and connect with your core Self, the more you’ll be able to engage positively with the outside world. You’ll be able to see others for who they are, free from your own projections. And, when you have internal harmony and a strong foundation, you’ll have much more capacity to help right the wrongs in the world.">Do you have internal harmony - connected to the self? Check for eight Cs: curiosity, courage, connectedness, compassion, confidence, calm, and clarity.</li>
        <li title="Some spiritual teachings argue that our bodily signals should be suppressed or tamed in order to achieve enlightenment. The body is seen as being full of primitive forces which can lead us astray. But in Internal Family Systems therapy, the body is just as important for healing as our minds – after all, they’re intimately connected.. To begin, set up as if you’re about to meditate. Sit somewhere you feel relaxed, and do some deep breathing to ground yourself before starting. Then do a scan of your body and mind, and notice any emotions, sensations, or impulses that emerge. As you sit there, check if there’s a particular feeling or thought clamoring for your attention. Observe it as closely as possible. Where is the feeling located in your body? And how do you react to it: are you scared, or disgusted? Ask any parts of yourself with strong reactions if they’d be prepared to step back for a moment, so you can get to know the sensation better. If your parts give you the space, address the sensation directly. Ask if there’s something it wants you to know. As a follow-up, ask it what it’s afraid would happen to you if it weren’t there. You can then express honest appreciation for the work it does in protecting you. Ask if there’s something it needs from you in the future, and listen to what it says. You’ve just made contact with one protector part. The first sensation you noticed when you sat down was a trailhead, leading you on a journey into your own mind and how it works.">Internal Family Systems therapy.</li>
        <li title="A powerful follow-up exercise is to create a personal map of your different parts. Grab a piece of paper and a pen, and repeat the beginning of the exercise where you scan your body and mind for sensations and emotions. But this time, instead of engaging deeply with one part, sketch a representation of each part that appears to you. Once you’ve got them all down, examine their relationships and how they interact with each other. You’ve just completed a mapping of your internal family. Like in any family, you may fight or let each other down sometimes. But if you keep taking the time to engage and connect, you’ll find that trust will grow, allowing even the most injured members to heal. And your internal family will become harmonious and grounded, enriching every aspect of your life.">Mapping of the internal family.</li>

        Inspired by The Loudest Guest by Amy Silver
        <li title="">List your fears, how do you experience it, what triggers it. How, when, and why you experience fear.</li>
        <li title="">Be alone with a cup of coffee/tea.</li>
        <li title="Draw a horizontal line from birth to now, split it to 5 chunks, write important experiences above the line and comment on how it has shaped the fear down below the line.">Separate your fear from yourself.</li>
        <li title="Earlier, you observed what triggers your fear – people, places, times, and spaces. When this happens, you also experience unconscious Fear Automatic Thoughts, or FATs. You can get closer to your fear if you start to recognize these and evaluate whether it's just fear talking. Ask yourself whether these FATs are needed, are of value, or can be ignored. Think of a time when you felt fear and try to write down what you were thinking – your FATs. Then ask yourself whether you have any evidence that your thoughts were true and whether there’s evidence to suggest they weren’t. Do the FATs relate to the specific situation or to the past? How would your best friend react to them? By evaluating your FATs in this way, you can also begin to develop alternatives. If you evaluate a FAT and find that it is true or useful, try reframing it in a positive light. For example, if you think everyone will know you’re nervous when you make a presentation, try framing it as, I’m going to connect really well with the audience. You can also evaluate your core fear beliefs in the same way. Although this may take time, you may eventually be able to substitute beliefs like I’m a failure into Sometimes I fail, and sometimes I succeed.">Evaluate your fear and identify its key messages.</li>
        <li title="Take some time to reflect on your goals in various aspects of your life and write them down. What are your work goals? Perhaps you see yourself in the top job one day. Do you have social goals? Maybe you’d like more friends or deeper relationships. What about fun goals like surfing Maui or trekking in the Amazon – or even something a little less dangerous, like baking your own bread? What are your well-being goals – eating three helpings of fruit per day or making sure you’re doing some movement every day, for example. Add in your financial goals – maybe investing an amount of money; and your learning goals – like enrolling in a photography course, or learning a new language. You can even write a contract with your fear – to approach it and experience discomfort rather than opting for avoidance and comfort. Sign and date it. You could even have someone witness it.">Decide to be courageous, and create a contract with your fear.</li>
        <li title="Make sure each goal you want to concentrate on is SMART – that is, Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-sensitive. Think about what fear says about them. Ask yourself how your goals would be different if fear wasn’t involved.">Consider SMART goals</li>
        <li title="E.g. look at spider images, use less protective clothing, etc. For example, do 10 or alike steps to achieve the fearless condition. When you choose a behavior that fear doesn’t like, you put yourself in the driver’s seat. Gradually increasing the discomfort you feel allows you to countermand fear’s choices. To do this, draw up a plan with steps 1 to 10 – where you are now is 1, and where you want to be is 10. Fill in the gaps making each step a little more challenging than the last. Overcoming your discomfort each time will bring more and more confidence.">Overcome your fear through experimentation.</li>
        <li title="Reduce the discomfort of your fear by calling on gratitude, forgiveness, and hope. Be grateful for the opportunity to challenge yourself. Approach social-risk situations from a position of forgiveness. And look to the future with optimism and hope. As you take control, fear may move the goalposts. But now that you know how to understand and control fear, you can go to the beginning of the cycle and start again. Make friends with fear and use it to drive yourself to be a better you.">Transform fear from controlling you to commenting for you.</li>
        <li title="Fear doesn’t want you to do this, of course, but imagine the helpful feedback you could get from others. Other people see you in a different light from the way you see yourself. They probably know more about you than you think, and perhaps better than you do yourself. Asking them for information about how they see you gives you an opportunity to grow and work toward being a better person. Don’t let fear hold you back.">Get feedback from others.</li>

        <li title="Researchers from Harvard Business School identified four typical types of pauses. Type one is the social break – like talking to your coworkers. Then, there’s the nutritional break that often involves a snack and maybe a glass of water. The relaxation break is time spent daydreaming or doing gentle exercise. Finally, there are cognition breaks, where you read a book or browse social media. This study showed that the only types of break that boosted productivity were the relaxation and social kinds. What’s more, cognitive breaks actually harmed performance. So, if you want to get the most out of your pause, close down that social media app, put away that newspaper, and wander over to a friend’s desk instead!">Make sure your breaks are mostly of type "social break", "nutritional break", "relaxation break", and not "cognitive breaks"</li>

        Inspired by Chaos by James Gleick
        <li title="Give the chaos game a try. The chaos game was invented by British mathematician Michael Barnsley to illustrate the idea that simple laws can create intricate patterns of chaos. You just need a coin, a piece of paper, and a pen. Start anywhere on the piece of paper. Then make a rule for head or tail, such as “for head, move 25 percent closer to the center,” or “for tail, move two inches south.” Now start flipping the coin and mark each new point on the paper. You’ll find that the chaos game doesn’t produce a random scattering of points – it actually starts revealing a distinct shape. Because even with random processes, there’s an order to the chaos.">Play a related game - learn from a simulation</li>
        <li title="Feigenbaum constants. Feigenbaum was interested in the boundary between order and chaos at which the shift into a new average state happens. He used a handheld calculator to determine the period-doubling bifurcations of different nonlinear equations. When he typed in the numbers for one of those equations, Feigenbaum noticed an unexpected regularity. The numbers were converging – joining together – geometrically. When Feigenbaum calculated the ratio of convergence for the period-doubling bifurcations of the equation, he got the number 4.6692016090. But the really startling discovery came when he calculated the ratio for a different nonlinear equation. He got exactly the same number. He repeated the calculations for all nonlinear equations he could find, and the result was always the same. Even biologist Robert May later remembered encountering this number when studying the nonlinear equations for changing animal populations. In his lab at Los Alamos, Feigenbaum began working frantically on his new theory. After two months of working 22 hours a day, he’d finally outlined the universal principle of the Feigenbaum constants. The Feigenbaum constants represented an important new aspect of the emerging field of chaos theory: universality. Up until then, scientists had believed that every nonlinear dynamical system had to be treated on a case-by-case basis. But Feigenbaum showed that there are certain features of nonlinear systems that remain unchanging, and can even be predicted. It wasn’t until 1979 that Feigenbaum’s theory was mathematically proved. But the discovery of the Feigenbaum constant was enough to unify the new field of chaos theory, and lend it the credibility that it previously lacked in the eyes of traditional scientists.

        <li title="1 of 9 habits. recruiting your drive. In order to recruit your drive, make sure your target is something you’re motivated to achieve. Then plan how you’ll do just that - split into quarters with goals, then break down to months, weeks.. don't set "what" only, set "why" too - why is the most important.">Recruite your drive</li>
        <li title="2 of 9 habits.  ignite your proactivity. This is all about how you structure individual days. Start by filling your daily calendar with investment time activities. Then, within that schedule, prioritize your Greatest Impact Activity, or GIA. This is the activity with the biggest long-term return on detailed, concentrated effort. Exactly what it is may vary from day to day, but in general, it’s best to work on your GIA early on in the day, when your mind is fresh. On those days when you’d rather stay in bed, try shifting your attitude by sitting up and saying “3, 2, 1, go!” That should give you the momentum you need. In other words: ignite proactivity - fill in with priority activities, prioritize, and 3-2-1-go! Upgrade empty time to investment. E.g. turn off notifications, change environment to more productive.">ignite your proactivity</li>
        <li title="3 of 9 habits. reengineer your habits. On one level this couldn’t be simpler: identify unproductive, empty-time habits – like Ari’s morning iPad routine – and upgrade them. But this also works on the micro scale. Take your phone, for example. When a notification comes in, do you immediately grab it and lose your concentration? If so, you can solve that problem by turning off unnecessary notifications. Or just train yourself to react differently. The next time it happens, remind yourself how much you’ll gain by staying focused and leaving your phone where it is. Changing your environment can be useful, too. Look around you and think about what aspects of your surroundings do and don’t help you concentrate. Fix them – find somewhere else to work if you need to. To really turbo-boost your productivity, though, it’s all about not space, but time.">reengineer your habits</li>
        <li title="4 of 9 habits. obsess over TIME. TIME - T is treasured time; I is investment time; M is mandatory time; and E is empty time. And once you start to break down your day into those four categories, you’re a big step closer to becoming extremely productive. What does it all mean in practice? Obsessing over your treasured, investment, mandatory, and empty time means figuring out where every single activity in your day fits within that structure. Then make sure that your priorities are reflected in your daily routine. How? Well, take treasured time. Increase investment time. Minimize mandatory time. And, as much as possible, eliminate empty time.">obsess over TIME. TIME - T is treasured time; I is investment time; M is mandatory time; and E is empty time</li>

        <li title="7 of 9 habits. 10-20 mins sprint, 4 sprints on the row with breaks. Discipline. Block off what Mike calls a sprint – 20 to 90 minutes set aside for productive work. Then try a relay, which is four sprints in a row with short breaks in between. Time your sprints with a stopwatch, but don’t use the one on your phone, which you definitely don’t want to be looking at. ">Break down activities into several 10-20 min sprints</li>
        <li title="8 of 9 habits. Nutrition for: mind, body, spirit. Encourage your mind through positive self-talk, and give it a break by minimizing decision-making. For instance, instead of wasting mental energy on deciding what to have for breakfast, just have the same thing every day. As for your body, you probably already know how to take care of it: eat nourishing food, get enough sleep, and exercise. But do you do these things? If not, it’s time to step up. Finally, there’s spirit: if you’re taking treasured time and doing meaningful work, you’re well on your way. ">Take care of Nutrition for: mind, body, spirit. </li>

And that’s why you need a Big Picture Goal – something you want to achieve, maybe months or, even better, years in the future. Write this down, then break it down into manageable steps: where will you need to be after two years? How about after one? Then figure out how to get there, including which targets you’ll need to hit every month, week, and day. Once your goal is broken down into chunks, you’ll start to see that it really is achievable.">Set a Big Picture Goal – and then break it down.</li>

        Inspired by Forget the Alamo by Bryan Burrough, Chris Tomlinson, Jason Stanford
        <li title="Generations of Americans have been taught a pretty simple story about the Battle of the Alamo. This traditional tale involved heroic figures who fought valiantly to their last breath in order to fight back against Mexican oppression and help liberate Texas. The historical facts present a far different picture. The Battle of the Alamo can be traced back to the conflict created when Mexico gained independence from Spain and made slavery illegal. This threatened the Anglo-American immigrants who relied on slavery for their lucrative cotton plantations. Tensions continued to rise, with Texians unwilling to accept Mexico’s new laws and led to a revolt that culminated in the Battle of the Alamo. While the battle was a catastrophic defeat for the Texians and Tejanos at the Alamo, the story was altered and used as inspiration to achieve independence from Mexico. That story has been harmful to generations of Latino-Americans living in Texas but is finally being revised to reflect a more historically accurate narrative that is perhaps best left to the dustbin of history.">Look for alternative truth.

What do you want your clothes to say about you? What about your hairstyle, your walk, or how you behave around others?
